# AmongUsCosmetics
A program that unlocks all cosmetics for Among Us (Steam version) 

Last tested on version 2022.10.25 but it probably works on newer versions too (if there are any). If it doesn't then feel free to make an issue 

This program probably isn't optimized very well, but it runs pretty fast. It was written in C++.

To use this, download and run the newset executable from the [releases](https://github.com/HackerHansen/AmongUsCosmetics/releases/) page. 

If you have the money to actually buy the cosmetics, I would encourage doing so to support the devs. They work hard to bring us a good game :) 

The functions isRunning and ProcessIdToName may have been copy pasted from somewhere, I've had them for a while now and can't remember if I actually wrote them or not
