# AmongUsCosmetics
A program that unlocks all cosmetics for Among Us (Steam version) 

Last tested on version 2022.10.25 but it probably works on newer versions too (if there are any). If it doesn't then feel free to make an issue 

This program probably isn't optimized very well, but it runs pretty fast. It was written in C++.

To use this, download and run the newset executable from the [releases](https://github.com/HackerHansen/AmongUsCosmetics/releases/) page. 

If you have the money to actually buy the cosmetics, I would encourage doing so to support the devs. They work hard to bring us a good game :) 

The functions isRunning and ProcessIdToName may have been copy pasted from somewhere, I've had them for a while now and can't remember if I actually wrote them or not 

## BEFORE MAKING AN ISSUE 

* No specific format is required but please make sure that I can actually tell what you're trying to say 

* If you're making an issue about the program no longer working or being outdated, check first if there is already a similar issue open. If not, feel free to open one titled "Not Working on the Latest Version" or something similar. 

* If you have problems with your antivirus, contact whoever made the antivirus, not me. Unless you're using Windows Defender, the only advice I'll be able to give is to disable your antivirus entirely, but this often may not be the best course of action if you want to, like, actually use your antivirus. If you're worried that this program actually *is* a virus, you can check out the source code and compile the program yourself. 

* If you want to use parts of my code from this repository for your own projects, you have full permission to do so as long as you give credit. 

* If I don't respond to an issue for more than a week, I probably forgot it existed (unless I stated somewhere that I would not be fixing the issue for a while). Feel free to reply to the issue and remind me. 

## CONTRIBUTING 

I doubt that anyone will actually make a pull request but if you decide to do that just make it, there's no format or anything
